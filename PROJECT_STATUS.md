## Key Architecture Decisions
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access (Student/Coordinator)
- Eligibility engine with demerits system

## Important Notes
- No student self-registration
- Coordinator creates all student accounts
- Temporary password system with forced change
- Complex eligibility rules (CGPA, demerits, offer jumps)
