# Day 2 Complete Summary - Database & Core Systems

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Migration
- Created complete Prisma migration files
- All database tables and relationships defined
- Ready to run when PostgreSQL is started

### 2. Complete API Structure
Built comprehensive REST API endpoints:

#### Authentication APIs
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with JWT
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration (Coordinator only)

#### Student Management APIs
- `GET /api/students` - List students with pagination/filtering
- `GET /api/students/[id]` - Get specific student details
- `PATCH /api/students/[id]` - Update student information
- `DELETE /api/students/[id]` - Delete student

#### Company Management APIs
- `GET /api/companies` - List companies with filtering
- `POST /api/companies` - Create new company

#### Application Management APIs
- `GET /api/applications` - List applications with filtering
- `POST /api/applications` - Create new application with eligibility check

#### Eligibility System APIs
- `POST /api/eligibility/check` - Check student eligibility for companies
- `GET /api/eligibility/check` - Quick eligibility overview

#### System APIs
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Eligibility Engine Integration
- Real-time eligibility checking in application API
- Bulk eligibility checking for multiple companies
- All business rules enforced (demerits, CGPA, offer jumps)

#### Authentication System
- JWT token generation and verification
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control middleware
- Temporary password generation for new accounts

#### Data Validation
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Unique constraint handling

#### Advanced Features
- Pagination support for list endpoints
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Transaction-based operations for data consistency
- Comprehensive error handling

## 🎯 Business Logic Implementation

### Eligibility Rules Enforced
- **Demerit System**: 2→1, 4→3, 6→5 company blocks
- **Offer Jump Policy**: Minimum +5 LPA increase required
- **CGPA Validation**: Exact values, no rounding
- **Department Restrictions**: Company-specific department filtering
- **Category Jump Limits**: Maximum 3 attempts tracked

### Database Relationships
- User → Student/Coordinator (one-to-one)
- Student → Applications (one-to-many)
- Company → Applications (one-to-many)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Placement blocks tracking

## 🚀 Ready for Day 3

### Next Steps
1. **Start PostgreSQL**: `docker-compose up -d`
2. **Run Migration**: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. **Test APIs**: Use health endpoint to verify
4. **Build Authentication UI**: Login/register pages
5. **Create Dashboard Components**: Student/Coordinator dashboards

### Database Commands
```bash
# Start database
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate

# View database
npx prisma studio

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```
